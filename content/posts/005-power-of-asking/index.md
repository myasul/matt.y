Like most Filipinos, I am extremely shy and nervous when I wanted something especially if it's about work or my career. I tend to just focus with the quality of my work and just hope that my peers or superiors would notice. I learned the hard way that most of the time you need to assert yourself for them to take notice. I learned that you need to openly tell them what you need. I wanted to share how being assertive and asking for what I want and/or need opened new doors for me.

## üåü New Opportunities

I took a couple of freelancing jobs when I was just starting out in programming. I really liked the work the work that I was doing with one of my clients back then. I loved how my client is giving me extensive feedback about my work for them and how I can make it better. I also loved how impactful their goal is (to eradicate energy poverty).

I knew I'm still too junior, but I took the courage to ask my client, who is the CTO of the company, if they have an opening for a developer of my level and if not, what are the skills I needed to build to be a part of their company. He came back to me with an offer! And that was the start of my career in the [coolest startup](https://www.mattyasul.com/blog/startup-challenges-rewards/) that I ever worked with.

If you know in yourself that have the guts and/or knowledge for the position that you want, there's no harm in trying to ask for that position. If they say you are not ready yet, you can always ask what are the things you need to learn or improve upon to get that dream job!

## üí≠ New Learnings

For the first few years in Okra, I was focused on building our web applications. It's not that I was getting bored of what I'm doing, actually I had a lot of fun! I learned JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and all other frontend technologies on the job! But I wanted to level-up my programming skills. I wanted to be a full-stack engineer (an engineer that can work both in the frontend and backend).

During my one-on-one with my team leader, I asked him if he can give me more backend focused features. I was surprised that he was delighted that I brought up that subject. He told me it was also in their plans to hone me as a full-stack engineer, and he was happy that I wanted the same thing. Starting that quarter, he gave more and more backend focused features. He also included me in design and planning meetings. After N bugs and features, I can confidently say that I can work both on the frontend and backend side of things!

There will come a time that you'll want to level-up, to learn more, but your superiors wouldn't know that you'd want that unless you proactively tell them! If that time comes, don't waste your time waiting, ask them if you can take a jab on that new feature, or try a different way to do the work you've always been doing the same way over and over again. It might come as a suprise that they also want the same thing for you!

## ü™¥ New Experiences

![First ever talk in a software development event!](images/reactjsph-talk.jpg)

I thought it would be awesome to share to my fellow PH web developers some of the stuff I learned from building production-ready web applications. One way to do that is to write blogs! So I started this blog and wrote a few of the stuff I learned from work! 

I didn't stop there. I always had stage-fright, and I wanted to conquer that fear so I contacted [ReactJS PH](https://reactjs.org.ph/) and asked if they have a slot for me in any of their upcoming events, because I'm willing to do a talk. It's hitting two birds with one stone! I can conquer my stage-fright and also share my learnings! They happily gave me a slot and had my talk finalized!

Shivering and full of stutters, I finished my first talk (it was about [JS bundle management](https://www.mattyasul.com/blog/nextjs-bundle-management/))! There are a lot of things I still can improve upon, but I'm always glad I did that talk! There are times there are gate keepers for the things you want to experience, most of the time you just need to politely ask them to open that gate for you!

## ü§ù New Connections

![After-event dinner with the ReactJS PH core team](images/with-reactjsph.jpg)

I've always wanted to build a network with other programmers, but it got so hard to do when COVID started. So when dev events started popping out I just went out there and joined the first one that I can join! I knew joining or talking to an event wouldn't cut it. I need to join a group in a more relaxed environment like lunch or dinner.

So when the ReactJS PH's Rehackt event was about to finish, I went out of my way and talked to one of the organizers. I asked if they are having dinner somewhere after the event and if they mind if I'll join. She gladly tagged me along! They even joined in the car to make sure that I won't get lost! It was awesome hearing their stories inside and outside software programming. 

Building new connections has a lot of benefits from being up-to-date to the latest trends, sharing ideas, promoting self-esteem, to developing long-lasting relationships. Next time you're in an event, put yourself out there! If you see a group you want to be a part of, ask them if you can join them for lunch or dinner! It's always good to build new connections and make new friends.

## üèÅ Wrapping Up
If you want to build that new feature, speak up! If you want to get that promotion, speak up! If you want to do that brownbag, speak up! If you want to be a part of that group, speak up! Most of the people around you are willing to help you out, you just need to ask them. It's up to you to open that door to endless possibilities.
