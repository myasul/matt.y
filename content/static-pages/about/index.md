Kamusta? I'm a software developer living in the Philippines. Welcome to my digital haven - a place where I share my thoughts, ideas, and learnings.

I currently work at [Okra Solar](https://www.okrasolar.com). We hustle really hard so that we can provide reliable access to power to those people still living off the grid (without electricity).

When I'm not writing code, I probably am brewing coffee, working out, or spending time with the my family and partner.

Please always feel free to say hi! I'm always happy to talk about technology, coffee, food, and anything in between!
