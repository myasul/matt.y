I'm a software developer living in the Philippines (Oo, Pinoy ako! Kabayan!). Welcome to my digital haven - a place where I share my thoughts, ideas, and learnings. When I'm not writing code, I probably am brewing coffee, working out, or spending time with the most beautiful girl sa balat ng lupa (too cheesy!).

I currently work at [Okra Solar](https://www.okrasolar.com). We hustle really hard so that we can provide reliable access to power to those people still living off the grid (without electricity).

Please always feel free to say hi! I'm always happy to talk about technology, coffee, food, and anything in between!
