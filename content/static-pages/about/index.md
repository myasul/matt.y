Kamusta? I'm a software developer living in the Philippines. Welcome to my digital haven - a place where I share my thoughts, ideas, and learnings.

I currently work at [Okra Solar](https://www.okrasolar.com). We hustle really hard so that we can provide reliable access to electricity for those people still living off the grid.

When I'm not writing code, I probably am brewing coffee, working out, or spending time with loved ones.

Please always feel free to say hi! I'm always happy to talk about technology, coffee, food, and anything in between!
